            <p class="para1">Timmie Willie is a country mouse who is accidentally taken to a city in a vegetable basket. When he wakes
                up, he finds himself at a party and makes a friend.</p>
            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <p class="para2">When he is unable to bear (tolerate or experience) the city life, he returns to his home but invites his
                friend to the village.</p>

            <h3>problem</h3>
            <p class="para3"> Humans have been living without cities or villages for most of history.</p>
            <h4>conclusion</h4>
            <p class="para4">That means that both village and city life are recent inventions. And just like every other invention, we
                need to decide their costs and benefits.</p>
